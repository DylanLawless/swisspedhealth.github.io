  <p>‚ÄúEach patient‚Äôs individual molecular makeup and unique characteristics will be the basis for guiding the medical decisions and restoring health.‚Äù
Personalized Health and Related Technologies (PHRT) is a strategic focus area of the ETH Domain; the latter embracing key research institutions like ETHZ, EPFL, PSI, EMPA, Eawag and WSL. PHRT‚Äôs goals include improving the quality of Personalized Health and Precision Medicine by providing a choice of individual therapeutic strategies for patients. PHRT aims to support and drive transformation in Personalized Health by providing clinicians with access to ETH technologies in order to evaluate their potential contributions to clinical decision making. The PHRT research program complements infrastructure efforts undertaken by the Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN) and the Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC). Within the PHRT program, SMOC is an engine for multi-omics data generation, analysis, interpretation. For secure data processing and sharing, SMOC is integrated into the SPHN/BioMEdIT secure computational infrastructure. <a href="http://smoc.ethz.ch/#overview">http://smoc.ethz.ch</a></p>
